Regular Expressions: Ignore Case While Matching
===============================================

You can match both cases using what is called a flag. There are other flags but the flag that ignores case is the i flag. You can use it by appending it to the regex. An example of using this flag is ```/ignorecase/i```. This regex can match the strings "ignorecase", "igNoreCase", and "IgnoreCase".
