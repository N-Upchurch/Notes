React: Use && for a More Concise Conditional
============================================

Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of `else if` statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the `&&` logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is `true`, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

`{condition && <p>markup</p>}`

If the `condition` is `true`, the markup will be returned. If the condition is `false`, the operation will immediately return `false` after evaluating the `condition` and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing `&&` after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your `render()` method without repeating a lot of code.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      display: !state.display
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         {this.state.display && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}
       </div>
    );
  }
};
```
