Redux: Handle an Action in the Store
====================================

After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a `reducer` function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A `reducer` takes `state` and `action` as arguments, and it always returns a new `state`. It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects â€” it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.

Another key principle in Redux is that `state` is read-only. In other words, the `reducer` function must always return a new copy of `state` and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions.

``` javascript 
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'LOGIN') {
    return {login: true}
  } else {
    return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
```
